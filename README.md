# COMP 4513 - Assignment #1

_**by Gareth Carvalho**_

Hey Randy,

This is the repository for my Assingment 1 Submission.

Just a note, services hosted on Render seem to go inactive after about an hour, and the first request before waking up takes about 20 seconds to get a response. So, unfortunately, you'll just have to bear with the slow response time on the first request, as it's not really feasible for me to send a request every hour for a few weeks.
